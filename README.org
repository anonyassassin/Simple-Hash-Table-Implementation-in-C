* Simple hash table implementation using C
This is a fun little project in which I have tried to implement hash table from scratch using C

** HOW TO USE IT?
1. Simply write all your code in main.c
2. Then type in *make* in your terminal.
   this will generate a executable called app
3. Simply run the executable with *./app* in your terminal
